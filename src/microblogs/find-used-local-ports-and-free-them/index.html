# Kill Process Running on a Specific Port

When you encounter "Port X is already in use" errors, you need to find and kill the process occupying that port.

## Windows (PowerShell)

### Find the process using the port

```powershell
netstat -ano | findstr :4221
```

Output example:
```
TCP    [::1]:4221    [::]:0    LISTENING    3912
```

The last number (3912) is the **Process ID (PID)**.

### Kill the process

```powershell
taskkill /F /PID 3912
```

### One-liner (find and kill)

```powershell
# Replace 4221 with your port number
$port = 4221
$pid = (Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort $port -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue).OwningProcess
if ($pid) { Stop-Process -Id $pid -Force; Write-Host "Killed process $pid" } else { Write-Host "No process on port $port" }
```

## Linux / macOS (Bash)

### Find the process using the port

```bash
lsof -i :4221
```

Or using netstat:

```bash
netstat -tulpn | grep :4221
```

### Kill the process

```bash
kill -9 3912
```

### One-liner (find and kill)

```bash
# Replace 4221 with your port number
kill -9 $(lsof -t -i:4221) 2>/dev/null && echo "Process killed" || echo "No process on port 4221"
```

Or using fuser:

```bash
fuser -k 4221/tcp
```

## Common Use Cases

- **Dev server conflicts**: When Angular/React/Node dev servers don't shut down properly
- **Docker port binding**: When containers leave ports occupied after stopping
- **Database connections**: When database servers (PostgreSQL, MySQL) hold onto ports

## Pro Tip

Add these as shell aliases for quick access:

**PowerShell (add to `$PROFILE`):**
```powershell
function killport($port) {
    $p = (Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort $port -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue).OwningProcess
    if ($p) { Stop-Process -Id $p -Force; "Killed PID $p on port $port" } else { "No process on port $port" }
}
```

**Bash (add to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`):**
```bash
killport() { kill -9 $(lsof -t -i:$1) 2>/dev/null && echo "Killed process on port $1" || echo "No process on port $1"; }
```

Then simply run: `killport 4221`
This will save you time and frustration when dealing with port conflicts!
