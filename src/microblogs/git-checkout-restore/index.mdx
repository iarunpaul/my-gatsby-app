## Git Checkout Commit & Git Restore Branch

When working with Git, you might need to check out a specific commit or restore a branch. Hereâ€™s how to do it efficiently.

### ðŸ›  Checking Out a Specific Commit

To temporarily switch your working directory to a past commit:

```sh
git checkout <commit-hash>
```

ðŸ”¹ **Warning**: This puts you in a detached HEAD state, meaning you're not on any branch. To create a new branch from this state:

```sh
git checkout -b new-branch-name
```

### ðŸ”„ Restoring a Branch

If you accidentally delete a branch and need to restore it:

```sh
git reflog
```
Find the commit where the branch was last active and then restore it:

```sh
git checkout -b branch-name <commit-hash>
```

### ðŸ”„ Using `git restore` (Git 2.23+)

For restoring files from a specific branch without switching branches:

```sh
git restore --source=<branch-name> -- <file-path>
```

Example:

```sh
git restore --source=develop -- src/config.json
```

This brings `config.json` from `develop` into the current branch without switching branches.

ðŸ’¡ **Pro Tip**: Use `git switch` instead of `git checkout` for changing branches in newer Git versions.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
