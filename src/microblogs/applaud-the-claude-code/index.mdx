# From 18 Build Errors to Lightning-Fast Tests: Optimizing .NET API Tests with Claude Code

## The Problem That Every Developer Knows Too Well

Picture this: You're working on a .NET API with comprehensive test coverage. Sounds great, right? Except your test suite takes **forever** to run, gets cancelled due to timeouts, and is so slow that developers avoid running tests locally. Sound familiar?

This is the story of how we used Claude Code to transform a sluggish, problematic API test suite into a high-performance testing machine that runs **60-80% faster** with zero build errors.

## Getting Started: When Tests Become a Bottleneck

Our API test project had all the right intentions:
- 200+ integration tests across 75+ controller test files
- Comprehensive HTTP client testing with `WebApplicationFactory`
- Strict mocking with `Moq.AutoMock`
- Full end-to-end API validation

But the execution was painful:

```bash
# The dreaded experience every developer faced
$ dotnet test
# ... 15 minutes later, still running ...
# ... build gets cancelled due to timeout ...
# 😤 Developer gives up and commits without running tests
# 💥Even worse, CI CD pipelines fail due to timeouts and assembly loading issues
```

The core issues were:
- Each test created its own `WebApplicationFactory` instance (200+ instances!)
- HTTP clients were created fresh for every test method
- `MockBehavior.Strict` required extensive setup and verification
- Tests ran sequentially with no parallelization
- Build errors from inconsistent mocking patterns

## Enter Claude Code: AI-Powered Problem Solving

Instead of manually debugging and optimizing, we decided to leverage Claude Code's analytical capabilities. Here's how the conversation started:

```console
> check the existing tests for the solution

Claude Code analyzed our test structure and identified the key bottlenecks:

├── API Tests (75+ controller test files)
├── Application Tests (60+ handler test files)
├── BDD/SpecFlow Tests (32 feature files)
└── Testing Frameworks: xUnit + Moq + ASP.NET Core Test Host

Key Testing Patterns Found:
- Heavy use of Moq.AutoMock for dependency injection
- Structured test data with realistic business scenarios
- Full HTTP client testing with authentication mocking
```

Then came the crucial insight:

```console
> the api testing is very slow because of strict mocking and http client testing.
> some efforts are already there to improve the test speed. But still the test
> are run for really long time in local, so that the tasks are cancelled during
> the run. Can you check it and suggest more improvements?

Claude Code's analysis revealed the smoking guns:

Performance Issues Identified:

Major Bottlenecks:
1. **WebApplicationFactory Recreation** - Each test creates a new instance
2. **Complete DI Container Rebuilding** - Every test rebuilds service collection
3. **HTTP Client Creation Overhead** - New HTTP clients per test method
4. **Strict Mocking** - MockBehavior.Strict requires more setup time
5. **No Parallelization** - Tests run sequentially without xUnit optimization
```

## The Optimization Strategy: A Multi-Layered Approach

Claude Code didn't just identify problems—it provided a comprehensive solution strategy with concrete implementation steps. Here's what we implemented:

### 1. Shared Test Fixtures: Stop Recreating Everything

**Before (The Slow Way):**
```csharp
public class MyApplicationSettingsControllerTests
{
    private WebApplicationFactory<Program> GetWebApplicationFactory(
        AutoMocker autoMocker,
        string? legacyAdministrationUserRights = null)
    {
        // Creating a NEW WebApplicationFactory for EVERY test
        var webApplicationFactory = new WebApplicationFactory<Program>()
            .WithTestAuthentication()
            .WithWebHostBuilder(builder =>
            {
                builder.ConfigureServices(services =>
                {
                    // Rebuilding entire DI container...
                    services.MockAuthorizationService(autoMocker);
                    services.MockFeatureFlagService(autoMocker);
                    // ... lots more setup
                });
            });
        return webApplicationFactory;
    }
}
```

**After (The Fast Way):**
```csharp
// Shared fixture that gets reused across ALL tests
public class ApiTestFixture : IDisposable
{
    public WebApplicationFactory<Program> Factory { get; }

    public ApiTestFixture()
    {
        Factory = new WebApplicationFactory<Program>()
            .WithTestAuthentication()
            .WithWebHostBuilder(builder =>
            {
                builder.UseSetting("registerFeatureCacheUpdater", false.ToString());
                // Minimal shared configuration
            });
    }
}

[Collection("API Tests")]
public class TestedApplicationsSettingsControllerTests : ControllerTestBase
{
    public TestedApplicationsSettingsControllerTests(ApiTestFixture fixture) : base(fixture)
    {
    }
    // Now using shared infrastructure!
}
```

### 2. HTTP Client Caching: Eliminate Connection Overhead

**The optimization that made a huge difference:**

```csharp
public static class WebApplicationFactoryExtensions
{
    private static readonly ConcurrentDictionary<string, HttpClient> _httpClientCache = new();
    private static readonly object _lockObject = new();

    public static HttpClient CreateHttpClientWithTestAuthentication<T>(
        this WebApplicationFactory<T> factory) where T : class
    {
        return CreateCachedHttpClient(factory, "DefaultHttpClient");
    }

    private static HttpClient CreateCachedHttpClient<T>(
        WebApplicationFactory<T> factory, string cacheKey) where T : class
    {
        var fullCacheKey = $"{typeof(T).Name}_{cacheKey}_{factory.GetHashCode()}";

        return _httpClientCache.GetOrAdd(fullCacheKey, _ =>
        {
            lock (_lockObject)
            {
                if (_httpClientCache.TryGetValue(fullCacheKey, out var existingClient))
                {
                    return existingClient;
                }

                var httpClient = factory.CreateClient(new WebApplicationFactoryClientOptions
                {
                    AllowAutoRedirect = false,
                });
                httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization =
                    new AuthenticationHeaderValue(TestAuthHandler.AuthenticationScheme);
                return httpClient;
            }
        });
    }
}
```

### 3. Relaxed Mocking: From Strict to Smart

**Before:**
```csharp
[Fact]
public async Task WhenCallingGetSettings_ItShouldCallItsDependencies()
{
    // Arrange
    AutoMocker autoMocker = new AutoMocker(MockBehavior.Strict); // 😱 Strict!

    // Tons of setup required for strict mocking...
    autoMocker.GetMock<ILicenseRetriever>()
        .Setup(l => l.RetrieveLicense(It.IsAny<string>()))
        .ReturnsAsync(licenseMock.Object);

    autoMocker.GetMock<IMediator>()
        .Setup(m => m.Send(It.IsAny<GetTestedApplicationsSettingsQuery>(), It.IsAny<CancellationToken>()))
        .ReturnsAsync(priceAgreementsSettings);

    // Act
    var result = await client.GetTestedApplicationsSettingsAsync();

    // Assert
    autoMocker.VerifyAll(); // 😱 Everything must be verified!
    result.Should().NotBeNull();
}
```

**After:**
```csharp
[Fact]
public async Task WhenCallingGetSettings_ItShouldCallItsDependencies()
{
    // Arrange
    var webApplicationFactory = CreateTestFactory(UserRightsGenerator.Generate());
    var client = webApplicationFactory.CreateTestedApplicationsSettingsClientWithTestAuthentication();

    // Only setup what we actually need
    var licenseMock = AutoMocker.GetMock<ILicense>();
    licenseMock.Setup(b => b.HasProductPart(ProductParts.ManageTestedApplications))
        .Returns(true);

    AutoMocker.GetMock<IMediator>()
        .Setup(m => m.Send(It.IsAny<GetTestedApplicationsSettingsQuery>(), It.IsAny<CancellationToken>()))
        .ReturnsAsync(priceAgreementsSettings);

    // Act
    var result = await client.GetTestedApplicationsSettingsAsync();

    // Assert - No verification needed with relaxed mocking!
    result.Should().NotBeNull();
}
```

### 4. Parallel Execution: Let Those Cores Work

Added `xunit.runner.json`:
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://xunit.net/schema/current/xunit.runner.schema.json",
  "parallelizeTestCollections": true,
  "maxParallelThreads": 4,
  "parallelizeAssembly": true,
  "preEnumerateTheories": false
}
```

## The Implementation Journey: 18 Build Errors to Success

When we applied these optimizations, we initially hit some snags. Claude Code helped us debug through each one:

```console
> apply all the recommendations

Claude Code generated all the optimization files and... 💥

> there are 18 build errors

Let me check the build errors and fix them systematically:

📋 **Build Error Analysis:**
1. SharedMocks method signature errors
2. WebApplicationFactory generic type casting
3. Missing using statements and namespace issues
4. TestedApplicationsSettingsControllerTests method references
5. Test the build after fixes

🔧 **Systematic Fixes Applied:**
- Fixed method signatures with proper parameter types
- Resolved generic type casting issues
- Added missing namespace imports
- Updated method references to use base class
- Fixed CancellationToken parameter requirements
```

The iterative debugging process showed Claude Code's strength in systematic problem-solving:

```console
$ dotnet build
C:\...\Controllers\TestedApplicationsSettingsControllerTests.cs(40,37):
error CS0103: The name 'GetWebApplicationFactory' does not exist in the current context

C:\...\Fixtures\SharedMocks.cs(54,27):
error CS1501: No overload for method 'HasUserRight' takes 2 arguments

[... 16 more errors ...]

> Let me fix these systematically...
```

After each fix:

```console
Build succeeded.
    7 Warning(s)
    0 Error(s) ✅

Time Elapsed 00:00:15.49
```

## The Base Test Class: Standardizing Excellence

One of the most powerful optimizations was creating a base test class:

```csharp
[Collection("API Tests")]
public abstract class ControllerTestBase : IDisposable
{
    protected readonly ApiTestFixture Fixture;
    protected readonly AutoMocker AutoMocker;
    protected readonly SharedMocks SharedMocks;

    protected ControllerTestBase(ApiTestFixture fixture)
    {
        Fixture = fixture;
        AutoMocker = new AutoMocker(MockBehavior.Default); // Relaxed!
        SharedMocks = new SharedMocks();
    }

    protected WebApplicationFactory<Program> CreateTestFactory(
        string? legacyAdministrationUserRights = null,
        Action<IServiceCollection>? configureServices = null)
    {
        return Fixture.Factory.WithWebHostBuilder(builder =>
        {
            builder.ConfigureServices(services =>
            {
                // Apply shared mocks
                services.MockAuthorizationService(AutoMocker);
                services.MockFeatureFlagService(AutoMocker);
                services.MockLicenseRetriever(AutoMocker);
                services.MockMediator(AutoMocker);

                // Setup default claims provider
                services.AddScoped(_ =>
                {
                    var claimsProviderMock = AutoMocker.GetMock<IClaimsProvider>();
                    claimsProviderMock
                        .Setup(x => x.GetAdministrationId())
                        .Returns(Guid.Parse("11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111"));
                    return claimsProviderMock.Object;
                });

                configureServices?.Invoke(services);
            });
        });
    }
}
```

## The Results: Performance Transformation

The before and after comparison was dramatic:

### Before Optimization:
```bash
$ dotnet test
# 🐌 5-10 minutes execution time
# ❌ Tests frequently cancelled due to timeouts
# 🔄 Sequential execution only
# 💾 200+ WebApplicationFactory instances
# 🏗️ Complete DI container rebuild per test
```

### After Optimization:
```bash
$ dotnet test
# ⚡ 60-80% faster execution
# ✅ No more timeout cancellations
# 🚀 4-thread parallel execution
# 💾 5-10 shared WebApplicationFactory instances
# 🏗️ Cached HTTP clients and shared services
```

**Concrete Improvements:**
- **Test Execution Time**: 60-80% reduction
- **Memory Usage**: Significantly reduced from shared fixtures
- **Build Errors**: From 18 to 0
- **Developer Experience**: From frustrating to pleasant
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Much faster feedback loops

## Migration Strategy: Making Change Manageable

Claude Code also provided tools for migration:

### Automated Migration Script
```powershell
# PowerShell script to help migrate test classes
param([string]$TestFilePattern = "*Tests.cs", [switch]$WhatIf = $false)

foreach ($file in $testFiles) {
    $content = Get-Content $filePath -Raw

    # Update class declaration
    $content = $content -replace $classPattern,
        "public class $className : ControllerTestBase"

    # Replace AutoMocker creation
    $content = $content -replace "new AutoMocker\(MockBehavior\.Strict\)",
        "AutoMocker // From base class"

    # Replace method calls
    $content = $content -replace "GetWebApplicationFactory\([^)]*\)",
        "CreateTestFactory(UserRightsGenerator.Generate())"
}
```

### Migration Guide
