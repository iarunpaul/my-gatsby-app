### What’s This Warning?
Git warns:
```bash
warning: in the working copy of 'gatsby-config.js', LF will be replaced by CRLF
```
This happens because Linux/macOS use **LF**, while Windows uses **CRLF** for line endings.

### What Does This Mean?
This warning appears when your repository has files with **LF (Line Feed)** line endings, but your local system (likely Windows) is set to use **CRLF (Carriage Return + Line Feed)**. Git is informing you that when it updates the file, it will convert the line endings accordingly.

### Why Does This Happen?
Different operating systems use different conventions for line endings:
- **Linux/macOS:** LF (`\n`)
- **Windows:** CRLF (`\r\n`)

### How to Fix It

- Keep LF (recommended for cross-platform projects):

  ```javascript
  git config --global core.autocrlf input
  ```
- Use Windows-style CRLF:
  ```javascript
  git config --global core.autocrlf true
  ```
- Enforce LF in a repo:
  ```javascript
  echo "* text=auto" > .gitattributes
  ```

Peace... 🍀
