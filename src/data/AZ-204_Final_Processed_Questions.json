The company supports agricultural production resources by distributing seeds fertilizers, chemicals, fuel, and farm machinery to the farms.Current Environment -The company is migrating all applications from an on-premises datacenter to Microsoft Azure. Applications support distributors, farmers, and internal company staff.Corporate website -• The company hosts a public website located at http://www.munsonspicklesandpreservesfarm.com. The site supports farmers and distributors who request agricultural production resources.Farms -• The company created a new customer tenant in the Microsoft Entra admin center to support authentication and authorization for applications.Distributors -• Distributors integrate their applications with data that is accessible by using APIs hosted at http://www.munsonspicklesandpreservesfarm.com/api to receive and update resource data.Requirements -The application components must meet the following requirements:Corporate website -• The site must be migrated to Azure App Service.• Costs must be minimized when hosting in Azure.• Applications must automatically scale independent of the compute resources.• All code changes must be validated by internal staff before release to production.• File transfer speeds must improve, and webpage-load performance must increase.• All site settings must be centrally stored, secured without using secrets, and encrypted at rest and in transit.• A queue-based load leveling pattern must be implemented by using Azure Service Bus queues to support high volumes of website agricultural production resource requests.Farms -• Farmers must authenticate to applications by using Microsoft Entra ID.Distributors -• The company must track a custom telemetry value with each API call and monitor performance of all APIs.• API telemetry values must be charted to evaluate variations and trends for resource data.Internal staff -• App and API updates must be validated before release to production.• Staff must be able to select a link to direct them back to the production app when validating an app or API update.• Staff profile photos and email must be displayed on the website once they authenticate to applications by using their Microsoft Entra ID.Security -• All web communications must be secured by using TLS/HTTPS.• Web content must be restricted by country/region to support corporate compliance standards.• The principle of least privilege must be applied when providing any user rights or process access rights.• Managed identities for Azure resources must be used to authenticate services that support Microsoft Entra ID authentication.Issues -Corporate website -• Farmers report HTTP 503 errors at the same time as internal staff report that CPU and memory usage are high.• Distributors report HTTP 502 errors at the same time as internal staff report that average response times and networking traffic are high.• Internal staff report webpage load sizes are large and take a long time to load.• Developers receive authentication errors to Service Bus when they debug locally.Distributors -• Many API telemetry values are sent in a short period of time. Telemetry traffic, data costs, and storage costs must be reduced while preserving a statistically correct analysis of the data points sent by the APIs.You need to configure App Service to support the corporate website migration.Which configuration should you use?

The company is based in Canada and has retail store locations across the world. The company is developing several cloud-based solutions to support their stores, distributors, suppliers, and delivery services.Current environment -Corporate website -The company provides a public website located at http://www.vanarsdelltd.com. The website consists of a React JavaScript user interface, HTML, CSS, image assets, and several APIs hosted in Azure Functions.Retail Store Locations -The company supports thousands of store locations globally. Store locations send data every hour to an Azure Blob storage account to support inventory, purchasing and delivery services. Each record includes a location identifier and sales transaction information.Requirements -The application components must meet the following requirements:Corporate website -• Secure the website by using SSL.• Minimize costs for data storage and hosting.• Implement native GitHub workflows for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD).• Distribute the website content globally for local use.• Implement monitoring by using Application Insights and availability web tests including SSL certificate validity and custom header value verification.• The website must have 99.95 percent uptime.Retail store locations -• Azure Functions must process data immediately when data is uploaded to Blob storage. Azure Functions must update Azure Cosmos DB by using native SQL language queries.• Audit store sale transaction information nightly to validate data, process sales financials, and reconcile inventory.Delivery services -• Store service telemetry data in Azure Cosmos DB by using an Azure Function. Data must include an item id, the delivery vehicle license plate, vehicle package capacity, and current vehicle location coordinates.• Store delivery driver profile information in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) by using an Azure Function called from the corporate website.Inventory services -The company has contracted a third-party to develop an API for inventory processing that requires access to a specific blob within the retail store storage account for three months to include read-only access to the data.Security -• All Azure Functions must centralize management and distribution of configuration data for different environments and geographies, encrypted by using a company-provided RSA-HSM key.• Authentication and authorization must use Azure AD and services must use managed identities where possible.Issues -Retail Store Locations -• You must perform a point-in-time restoration of the retail store location data due to an unexpected and accidental deletion of data.• Azure Cosmos DB queries from the Azure Function exhibit high Request Unit (RU) usage and contain multiple, complex queries that exhibit high point read latency for large items as the function app is scaling.You need to implement the delivery service telemetry data.How should you configure the solution?

Testing must support the latest versions of the Azure Storage APIs.Corporate website -• User authentication and authorization must allow one-time passcode sign-in methods and social identity providers (Google or Facebook).• Static web content must be stored closest to end users to reduce network latency.Inventory items -• Customized items read from Azure Cosmos DB must maximize throughput while ensuring data is accurate for the current user on the website.• Processing of inventory item updates must automatically scale and enable updates across an entire Azure Cosmos DB container.• Inventory items must be processed in the order they were placed in the queue.• Inventory item images must be stored as JPEG files in their native format to include exchangeable image file format (data) stored with the blob data upon upload of the image file.• The Inventory Items API must securely access the Azure Cosmos DB data.Orders -• Orders must receive inventory item changes automatically after inventory items are updated or saved.Issues -• Developers are storing the Azure Cosmos DB credentials in an insecure clear text manner within the Inventory Items API code.• Production Azure Cache for Redis maintenance has negatively affected application performance.You need to support local development testing for developers.Which tool should you use?",

The company supports agricultural production resources by distributing seeds fertilizers, chemicals, fuel, and farm machinery to the farms.Current Environment -The company is migrating all applications from an on-premises datacenter to Microsoft Azure. Applications support distributors, farmers, and internal company staff.Corporate website -• The company hosts a public website located at http://www.munsonspicklesandpreservesfarm.com. The site supports farmers and distributors who request agricultural production resources.Farms -• The company created a new customer tenant in the Microsoft Entra admin center to support authentication and authorization for applications.Distributors -• Distributors integrate their applications with data that is accessible by using APIs hosted at http://www.munsonspicklesandpreservesfarm.com/api to receive and update resource data.Requirements -The application components must meet the following requirements:Corporate website -• The site must be migrated to Azure App Service.• Costs must be minimized when hosting in Azure.• Applications must automatically scale independent of the compute resources.• All code changes must be validated by internal staff before release to production.• File transfer speeds must improve, and webpage-load performance must increase.• All site settings must be centrally stored, secured without using secrets, and encrypted at rest and in transit.• A queue-based load leveling pattern must be implemented by using Azure Service Bus queues to support high volumes of website agricultural production resource requests.Farms -• Farmers must authenticate to applications by using Microsoft Entra ID.Distributors -• The company must track a custom telemetry value with each API call and monitor performance of all APIs.• API telemetry values must be charted to evaluate variations and trends for resource data.Internal staff -• App and API updates must be validated before release to production.• Staff must be able to select a link to direct them back to the production app when validating an app or API update.• Staff profile photos and email must be displayed on the website once they authenticate to applications by using their Microsoft Entra ID.Security -• All web communications must be secured by using TLS/HTTPS.• Web content must be restricted by country/region to support corporate compliance standards.• The principle of least privilege must be applied when providing any user rights or process access rights.• Managed identities for Azure resources must be used to authenticate services that support Microsoft Entra ID authentication.Issues -Corporate website -• Farmers report HTTP 503 errors at the same time as internal staff report that CPU and memory usage are high.• Distributors report HTTP 502 errors at the same time as internal staff report that average response times and networking traffic are high.• Internal staff report webpage load sizes are large and take a long time to load.• Developers receive authentication errors to Service Bus when they debug locally.Distributors -• Many API telemetry values are sent in a short period of time. Telemetry traffic, data costs, and storage costs must be reduced while preserving a statistically correct analysis of the data points sent by the APIs.You need to configure all site configuration settings for the corporate website.Which three actions should you perform?

The company is based in Canada and has retail store locations across the world. The company is developing several cloud-based solutions to support their stores, distributors, suppliers, and delivery services.Current environment -Corporate website -The company provides a public website located at http://www.vanarsdelltd.com. The website consists of a React JavaScript user interface, HTML, CSS, image assets, and several APIs hosted in Azure Functions.Retail Store Locations -The company supports thousands of store locations globally. Store locations send data every hour to an Azure Blob storage account to support inventory, purchasing and delivery services. Each record includes a location identifier and sales transaction information.Requirements -The application components must meet the following requirements:Corporate website -• Secure the website by using SSL.• Minimize costs for data storage and hosting.• Implement native GitHub workflows for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD).• Distribute the website content globally for local use.• Implement monitoring by using Application Insights and availability web tests including SSL certificate validity and custom header value verification.• The website must have 99.95 percent uptime.Retail store locations -• Azure Functions must process data immediately when data is uploaded to Blob storage. Azure Functions must update Azure Cosmos DB by using native SQL language queries.• Audit store sale transaction information nightly to validate data, process sales financials, and reconcile inventory.Delivery services -• Store service telemetry data in Azure Cosmos DB by using an Azure Function. Data must include an item id, the delivery vehicle license plate, vehicle package capacity, and current vehicle location coordinates.• Store delivery driver profile information in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) by using an Azure Function called from the corporate website.Inventory services -The company has contracted a third-party to develop an API for inventory processing that requires access to a specific blob within the retail store storage account for three months to include read-only access to the data.Security -• All Azure Functions must centralize management and distribution of configuration data for different environments and geographies, encrypted by using a company-provided RSA-HSM key.• Authentication and authorization must use Azure AD and services must use managed identities where possible.Issues -Retail Store Locations -• You must perform a point-in-time restoration of the retail store location data due to an unexpected and accidental deletion of data.• Azure Cosmos DB queries from the Azure Function exhibit high Request Unit (RU) usage and contain multiple, complex queries that exhibit high point read latency for large items as the function app is scaling.You need to test the availability of the corporate website.Which two test types can you use?

The solution consists of an ASP.NET Core WebAPI project that is deployed as an Azure Web App.Overall architecture -Employees upload receipts for the system to process. When processing is complete, the employee receives a summary report email that details the processing results. Employees then use a web application to manage their receipts and perform any additional tasks needed for reimbursement.Receipt processing -Employees may upload receipts in two ways: Uploading using an Azure Files mounted folder Uploading using the web applicationData Storage -Receipt and employee information is stored in an Azure SQL database.Documentation -Employees are provided with a getting started document when they first use the solution. The documentation includes details on supported operating systems forAzure File upload, and instructions on how to configure the mounted folder.Solution details -Users table -Web Application -You enable MSI for the Web App and configure the Web App to use the security principal name WebAppIdentity.Processing -Processing is performed by an Azure Function that uses version 2 of the Azure Function runtime. Once processing is completed, results are stored in Azure BlobStorage and an Azure SQL database. Then, an email summary is sent to the user with a link to the processing report. The link to the report must remain valid if the email is forwarded to another user.Logging -Azure Application Insights is used for telemetry and logging in both the processor and the web application. The processor also has TraceWriter logging enabled.Application Insights must always contain all log messages.Requirements -Receipt processing -Concurrent processing of a receipt must be prevented.Disaster recovery -Regional outage must not impact application availability. All DR operations must not be dependent on application running and must ensure that data in the DR region is up to date.Security - User's SecurityPin must be stored in such a way that access to the database does not allow the viewing of SecurityPins. The web application is the only system that should have access to SecurityPins. All certificates and secrets used to secure data must be stored in Azure Key Vault. You must adhere to the principle of least privilege and provide privileges which are essential to perform the intended function. All access to Azure Storage and Azure SQL database must use the application's Managed Service Identity (MSI). Receipt data must always be encrypted at rest. All data must be protected in transit. User's expense account number must be visible only to logged in users. All other views of the expense account number should include only the last segment, with the remaining parts obscured. In the case of a security breach, access to all summary reports must be revoked without impacting other parts of the system.Issues -Upload format issue -Employees occasionally report an issue with uploading a receipt using the web application. They report that when they upload a receipt using the Azure FileShare, the receipt does not appear in their profile. When this occurs, they delete the file in the file share and use the web application, which returns a 500 InternalServer error page.Capacity issue -During busy periods, employees report long delays between the time they upload the receipt and when it appears in the web application.Log capacity issue -Developers report that the number of log messages in the trace output for the processor is too high, resulting in lost log messages.Application code -Processing.cs -Database.cs -ReceiptUploader.cs -ConfigureSSE.ps1 - Question DRAG DROP -You need to add code at line PC32 in Processing.cs to implement the GetCredentials method in the Processing class.How should you complete the code? To answer, drag the appropriate code segments to the correct locations. Each code segment may be used once, more than once, or not at all.

However, there may be additional case studies and sections on this exam. You must manage your time to ensure that you are able to complete all questions included on this exam in the time provided.To answer the questions included in a case study, you will need to reference information that is provided in the case study. Case studies might contain exhibits and other resources that provide more information about the scenario that is described in the case study. Each question is independent of the other questions in this case study.At the end of this case study, a review screen will appear. This screen allows you to review your answers and to make changes before you move to the next section of the exam. After you begin a new section, you cannot return to this section.To start the case study -To display the first question in this case study, click the Next button. Use the buttons in the left pane to explore the content of the case study before you answer the questions. Clicking these buttons displays information such as business requirements, existing environment, and problem statements. When you are ready to answer a question, click the Question button to return to the question.Background -You are a developer for Litware Inc., a SaaS company that provides a solution for managing employee expenses. The solution consists of an ASP.NET Core WebAPI project that is deployed as an Azure Web App.Overall architecture -Employees upload receipts for the system to process. When processing is complete, the employee receives a summary report email that details the processing results. Employees then use a web application to manage their receipts and perform any additional tasks needed for reimbursement.Receipt processing -Employees may upload receipts in two ways: Uploading using an Azure Files mounted folder Uploading using the web applicationData Storage -Receipt and employee information is stored in an Azure SQL database.Documentation -Employees are provided with a getting started document when they first use the solution. The documentation includes details on supported operating systems forAzure File upload, and instructions on how to configure the mounted folder.Solution details -Users table -Web Application -You enable MSI for the Web App and configure the Web App to use the security principal name WebAppIdentity.Processing -Processing is performed by an Azure Function that uses version 2 of the Azure Function runtime. Once processing is completed, results are stored in Azure BlobStorage and an Azure SQL database. Then, an email summary is sent to the user with a link to the processing report. The link to the report must remain valid if the email is forwarded to another user.Logging -Azure Application Insights is used for telemetry and logging in both the processor and the web application. The processor also has TraceWriter logging enabled.Application Insights must always contain all log messages.Requirements -Receipt processing -Concurrent processing of a receipt must be prevented.Disaster recovery -Regional outage must not impact application availability. All DR operations must not be dependent on application running and must ensure that data in the DR region is up to date.Security - User's SecurityPin must be stored in such a way that access to the database does not allow the viewing of SecurityPins. The web application is the only system that should have access to SecurityPins. All certificates and secrets used to secure data must be stored in Azure Key Vault. You must adhere to the principle of least privilege and provide privileges which are essential to perform the intended function. All access to Azure Storage and Azure SQL database must use the application's Managed Service Identity (MSI). Receipt data must always be encrypted at rest. All data must be protected in transit. User's expense account number must be visible only to logged in users. All other views of the expense account number should include only the last segment, with the remaining parts obscured. In the case of a security breach, access to all summary reports must be revoked without impacting other parts of the system.Issues -Upload format issue -Employees occasionally report an issue with uploading a receipt using the web application. They report that when they upload a receipt using the Azure FileShare, the receipt does not appear in their profile. When this occurs, they delete the file in the file share and use the web application, which returns a 500 InternalServer error page.Capacity issue -During busy periods, employees report long delays between the time they upload the receipt and when it appears in the web application.Log capacity issue -Developers report that the number of log messages in the trace output for the processor is too high, resulting in lost log messages.Application code -Processing.cs -Database.cs -ReceiptUploader.cs -ConfigureSSE.ps1 - Question DRAG DROP -You need to ensure disaster recovery requirements are met.What code should you add at line PC16?To answer, drag the appropriate code fragments to the correct locations. Each code fragment may be used once, more than once, or not at all. You may need to drag the split bar between panes or scroll to view content.NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.Select and Place:",

When you are ready to answer a question, click the Question button to return to the question.Background -VanArsdel, Ltd. is a global office supply company. The company is based in Canada and has retail store locations across the world. The company is developing several cloud-based solutions to support their stores, distributors, suppliers, and delivery services.Current environment -Corporate website -The company provides a public website located at http://www.vanarsdelltd.com. The website consists of a React JavaScript user interface, HTML, CSS, image assets, and several APIs hosted in Azure Functions.Retail Store Locations -The company supports thousands of store locations globally. Store locations send data every hour to an Azure Blob storage account to support inventory, purchasing and delivery services. Each record includes a location identifier and sales transaction information.Requirements -The application components must meet the following requirements:Corporate website - Secure the website by using SSL. Minimize costs for data storage and hosting. Implement native GitHub workflows for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). Distribute the website content globally for local use. Implement monitoring by using Application Insights and availability web tests including SSL certificate validity and custom header value verification. The website must have 99.95 percent uptime.Retail store locations - Azure Functions must process data immediately when data is uploaded to Blob storage. Azure Functions must update Azure Cosmos DB by using native SQL language queries. Audit store sale transaction information nightly to validate data, process sales financials, and reconcile inventory.Delivery services - Store service telemetry data in Azure Cosmos DB by using an Azure Function. Data must include an item id, the delivery vehicle license plate, vehicle package capacity, and current vehicle location coordinates. Store delivery driver profile information in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) by using an Azure Function called from the corporate website.Inventory services -The company has contracted a third-party to develop an API for inventory processing that requires access to a specific blob within the retail store storage account for three months to include read-only access to the data.Security - All Azure Functions must centralize management and distribution of configuration data for different environments and geographies, encrypted by using a company-provided RSA-HSM key. Authentication and authorization must use Azure AD and services must use managed identities where possible.Issues -Retail Store Locations - You must perform a point-in-time restoration of the retail store location data due to an unexpected and accidental deletion of data. Azure Cosmos DB queries from the Azure Function exhibit high Request Unit (RU) usage and contain multiple, complex queries that exhibit high point read latency for large items as the function app is scaling. Question You need to secure the Azure Functions to meet the security requirements.Which two actions should you perform? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.",

The company has developed several applications and services to support supply chain operations and would like to leverage serverless computing where possible.Current environment -Windows Server 2016 virtual machineThis virtual machine (VM) runs BizTalk Server 2016. The VM runs the following workflows: Ocean Transport `\" This workflow gathers and validates container information including container contents and arrival notices at various shipping ports. Inland Transport `\" This workflow gathers and validates trucking information including fuel usage, number of stops, and routes.The VM supports the following REST API calls: Container API `\" This API provides container information including weight, contents, and other attributes. Location API `\" This API provides location information regarding shipping ports of call and trucking stops. Shipping REST API `\" This API provides shipping information for use and display on the shipping website.Shipping Data -The application uses MongoDB JSON document storage database for all container and transport information.Shipping Web Site -The site displays shipping container tracking information and container contents. The site is located at http://shipping.wideworldimporters.com/Proposed solution -The on-premises shipping application must be moved to Azure. The VM has been migrated to a new Standard_D16s_v3 Azure VM by using Azure Site Recovery and must remain running in Azure to complete the BizTalk component migrations. You create a Standard_D16s_v3 Azure VM to host BizTalk Server. The Azure architecture diagram for the proposed solution is shown below:Requirements -Shipping Logic app -The Shipping Logic app must meet the following requirements: Support the ocean transport and inland transport workflows by using a Logic App. Support industry-standard protocol X12 message format for various messages including vessel content details and arrival notices. Secure resources to the corporate VNet and use dedicated storage resources with a fixed costing model. Maintain on-premises connectivity to support legacy applications and final BizTalk migrations.Shipping Function app -Implement secure function endpoints by using app-level security and include Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).REST APIs -The REST API's that support the solution must meet the following requirements: Secure resources to the corporate VNet. Allow deployment to a testing location within Azure while not incurring additional costs. Automatically scale to double capacity during peak shipping times while not causing application downtime. Minimize costs when selecting an Azure payment model.Shipping data -Data migration from on-premises to Azure must minimize costs and downtime.Shipping website -Use Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) and ensure maximum performance for dynamic content while minimizing latency and costs.Issues -Windows Server 2016 VM -The VM shows high network latency, jitter, and high CPU utilization. The VM is critical and has not been backed up in the past. The VM must enable a quick restore from a 7-day snapshot to include in-place restore of disks in case of failure.Shipping website and REST APIs -The following error message displays while you are testing the website:Failed to load http://test-shippingapi.wideworldimporters.com/: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.

The company is migrating solutions to Azure.Current environment -Architecture overview -The company has a public website located at http://www.cpandl.com/. The site is a single-page web application that runs in Azure App Service on Linux. The website uses files stored in Azure Storage and cached in Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) to serve static content.API Management and Azure Function App functions are used to process and store data in Azure Database for PostgreSQL. API Management is used to broker communications to the Azure Function app functions for Logic app integration. Logic apps are used to orchestrate the data processing while Service Bus andEvent Grid handle messaging and events.The solution uses Application Insights, Azure Monitor, and Azure Key Vault.Architecture diagram -The company has several applications and services that support their business. The company plans to implement serverless computing where possible. The overall architecture is shown below.User authentication -The following steps detail the user authentication process:1. The user selects Sign in in the website.2. The browser redirects the user to the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) sign in page.3. The user signs in.4. Azure AD redirects the user's session back to the web application. The URL includes an access token.5. The web application calls an API and includes the access token in the authentication header. The application ID is sent as the audience ('aud') claim in the access token.6. The back-end API validates the access token.Requirements -Corporate website - Communications and content must be secured by using SSL. Communications must use HTTPS. Data must be replicated to a secondary region and three availability zones. Data storage costs must be minimized.Azure Database for PostgreSQL -The database connection string is stored in Azure Key Vault with the following attributes: Azure Key Vault name: cpandlkeyvault Secret name: PostgreSQLConn Id: 80df3e46ffcd4f1cb187f79905e9a1e8The connection information is updated frequently. The application must always use the latest information to connect to the database.Azure Service Bus and Azure Event Grid Azure Event Grid must use Azure Service Bus for queue-based load leveling. Events in Azure Event Grid must be routed directly to Service Bus queues for use in buffering. Events from Azure Service Bus and other Azure services must continue to be routed to Azure Event Grid for processing.Security - All SSL certificates and credentials must be stored in Azure Key Vault. File access must restrict access by IP, protocol, and Azure AD rights. All user accounts and processes must receive only those privileges which are essential to perform their intended function.Compliance -Auditing of the file updates and transfers must be enabled to comply with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The file updates must be read-only, stored in the order in which they occurred, include only create, update, delete, and copy operations, and be retained for compliance reasons.Issues -Corporate website -While testing the site, the following error message displays:CryptographicException: The system cannot find the file specified.Function app -You perform local testing for the RequestUserApproval function. The following error message displays:'Timeout value of 00:10:00 exceeded by function: RequestUserApproval'The same error message displays when you test the function in an Azure development environment when you run the following Kusto query:FunctionAppLogs -| where FunctionName = = \"RequestUserApproval\"Logic app -You test the Logic app in a development environment. The following error message displays:'400 Bad Request'Troubleshooting of the error shows an HttpTrigger action to call the RequestUserApproval function.Code -Corporate website -Security.cs:Function app -RequestUserApproval.cs: Question You need to authenticate the user to the corporate website as indicated by the architectural diagram.Which two values should you use?

The solution consists of an ASP.NET Core WebAPI project that is deployed as an Azure Web App.Overall architecture -Employees upload receipts for the system to process. When processing is complete, the employee receives a summary report email that details the processing results. Employees then use a web application to manage their receipts and perform any additional tasks needed for reimbursement.Receipt processing -Employees may upload receipts in two ways: Uploading using an Azure Files mounted folder Uploading using the web applicationData Storage -Receipt and employee information is stored in an Azure SQL database.Documentation -Employees are provided with a getting started document when they first use the solution. The documentation includes details on supported operating systems forAzure File upload, and instructions on how to configure the mounted folder.Solution details -Users table -Web Application -You enable MSI for the Web App and configure the Web App to use the security principal name WebAppIdentity.Processing -Processing is performed by an Azure Function that uses version 2 of the Azure Function runtime. Once processing is completed, results are stored in Azure BlobStorage and an Azure SQL database. Then, an email summary is sent to the user with a link to the processing report. The link to the report must remain valid if the email is forwarded to another user.Logging -Azure Application Insights is used for telemetry and logging in both the processor and the web application. The processor also has TraceWriter logging enabled.Application Insights must always contain all log messages.Requirements -Receipt processing -Concurrent processing of a receipt must be prevented.Disaster recovery -Regional outage must not impact application availability. All DR operations must not be dependent on application running and must ensure that data in the DR region is up to date.Security - User's SecurityPin must be stored in such a way that access to the database does not allow the viewing of SecurityPins. The web application is the only system that should have access to SecurityPins. All certificates and secrets used to secure data must be stored in Azure Key Vault. You must adhere to the principle of least privilege and provide privileges which are essential to perform the intended function. All access to Azure Storage and Azure SQL database must use the application's Managed Service Identity (MSI). Receipt data must always be encrypted at rest. All data must be protected in transit. User's expense account number must be visible only to logged in users. All other views of the expense account number should include only the last segment, with the remaining parts obscured. In the case of a security breach, access to all summary reports must be revoked without impacting other parts of the system.Issues -Upload format issue -Employees occasionally report an issue with uploading a receipt using the web application. They report that when they upload a receipt using the Azure FileShare, the receipt does not appear in their profile. When this occurs, they delete the file in the file share and use the web application, which returns a 500 InternalServer error page.Capacity issue -During busy periods, employees report long delays between the time they upload the receipt and when it appears in the web application.Log capacity issue -Developers report that the number of log messages in the trace output for the processor is too high, resulting in lost log messages.Application code -Processing.cs -Database.cs -ReceiptUploader.cs -ConfigureSSE.ps1 - Question HOTSPOT -You need to add code at line PC26 of Processing.cs to ensure that security policies are met.How should you complete the code that you will add at line PC26?

The company is based in Canada and has retail store locations across the world. The company is developing several cloud-based solutions to support their stores, distributors, suppliers, and delivery services.Current environment -Corporate website -The company provides a public website located at http://www.vanarsdelltd.com. The website consists of a React JavaScript user interface, HTML, CSS, image assets, and several APIs hosted in Azure Functions.Retail Store Locations -The company supports thousands of store locations globally. Store locations send data every hour to an Azure Blob storage account to support inventory, purchasing and delivery services. Each record includes a location identifier and sales transaction information.Requirements -The application components must meet the following requirements:Corporate website - Secure the website by using SSL. Minimize costs for data storage and hosting. Implement native GitHub workflows for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). Distribute the website content globally for local use. Implement monitoring by using Application Insights and availability web tests including SSL certificate validity and custom header value verification. The website must have 99.95 percent uptime.Retail store locations - Azure Functions must process data immediately when data is uploaded to Blob storage. Azure Functions must update Azure Cosmos DB by using native SQL language queries. Audit store sale transaction information nightly to validate data, process sales financials, and reconcile inventory.Delivery services - Store service telemetry data in Azure Cosmos DB by using an Azure Function. Data must include an item id, the delivery vehicle license plate, vehicle package capacity, and current vehicle location coordinates. Store delivery driver profile information in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) by using an Azure Function called from the corporate website.Inventory services -The company has contracted a third-party to develop an API for inventory processing that requires access to a specific blob within the retail store storage account for three months to include read-only access to the data.Security - All Azure Functions must centralize management and distribution of configuration data for different environments and geographies, encrypted by using a company-provided RSA-HSM key. Authentication and authorization must use Azure AD and services must use managed identities where possible.Issues -Retail Store Locations - You must perform a point-in-time restoration of the retail store location data due to an unexpected and accidental deletion of data. Azure Cosmos DB queries from the Azure Function exhibit high Request Unit (RU) usage and contain multiple, complex queries that exhibit high point read latency for large items as the function app is scaling. Question You need to reduce read latency for the retail store solution.What are two possible ways to achieve the goal? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

The website uses files stored in Azure Storage and cached in Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) to serve static content.API Management and Azure Function App functions are used to process and store data in Azure Database for PostgreSQL. API Management is used to broker communications to the Azure Function app functions for Logic app integration. Logic apps are used to orchestrate the data processing while Service Bus andEvent Grid handle messaging and events.The solution uses Application Insights, Azure Monitor, and Azure Key Vault.Architecture diagram -The company has several applications and services that support their business. The company plans to implement serverless computing where possible. The overall architecture is shown below.User authentication -The following steps detail the user authentication process:1. The user selects Sign in in the website.2. The browser redirects the user to the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) sign in page.3. The user signs in.4. Azure AD redirects the user's session back to the web application. The URL includes an access token.5. The web application calls an API and includes the access token in the authentication header. The application ID is sent as the audience ('aud') claim in the access token.6. The back-end API validates the access token.Requirements -Corporate website - Communications and content must be secured by using SSL. Communications must use HTTPS. Data must be replicated to a secondary region and three availability zones. Data storage costs must be minimized.Azure Database for PostgreSQL -The database connection string is stored in Azure Key Vault with the following attributes: Azure Key Vault name: cpandlkeyvault Secret name: PostgreSQLConn Id: 80df3e46ffcd4f1cb187f79905e9a1e8The connection information is updated frequently. The application must always use the latest information to connect to the database.Azure Service Bus and Azure Event Grid Azure Event Grid must use Azure Service Bus for queue-based load leveling. Events in Azure Event Grid must be routed directly to Service Bus queues for use in buffering. Events from Azure Service Bus and other Azure services must continue to be routed to Azure Event Grid for processing.Security - All SSL certificates and credentials must be stored in Azure Key Vault. File access must restrict access by IP, protocol, and Azure AD rights. All user accounts and processes must receive only those privileges which are essential to perform their intended function.Compliance -Auditing of the file updates and transfers must be enabled to comply with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The file updates must be read-only, stored in the order in which they occurred, include only create, update, delete, and copy operations, and be retained for compliance reasons.Issues -Corporate website -While testing the site, the following error message displays:CryptographicException: The system cannot find the file specified.Function app -You perform local testing for the RequestUserApproval function. The following error message displays:'Timeout value of 00:10:00 exceeded by function: RequestUserApproval'The same error message displays when you test the function in an Azure development environment when you run the following Kusto query:FunctionAppLogs -| where FunctionName = = \"RequestUserApproval\"Logic app -You test the Logic app in a development environment.

The solution consists of an ASP.NET Core WebAPI project that is deployed as an Azure Web App.Overall architecture -Employees upload receipts for the system to process. When processing is complete, the employee receives a summary report email that details the processing results. Employees then use a web application to manage their receipts and perform any additional tasks needed for reimbursement.Receipt processing -Employees may upload receipts in two ways: Uploading using an Azure Files mounted folder Uploading using the web applicationData Storage -Receipt and employee information is stored in an Azure SQL database.Documentation -Employees are provided with a getting started document when they first use the solution. The documentation includes details on supported operating systems forAzure File upload, and instructions on how to configure the mounted folder.Solution details -Users table -Web Application -You enable MSI for the Web App and configure the Web App to use the security principal name WebAppIdentity.Processing -Processing is performed by an Azure Function that uses version 2 of the Azure Function runtime. Once processing is completed, results are stored in Azure BlobStorage and an Azure SQL database. Then, an email summary is sent to the user with a link to the processing report. The link to the report must remain valid if the email is forwarded to another user.Logging -Azure Application Insights is used for telemetry and logging in both the processor and the web application. The processor also has TraceWriter logging enabled.Application Insights must always contain all log messages.Requirements -Receipt processing -Concurrent processing of a receipt must be prevented.Disaster recovery -Regional outage must not impact application availability. All DR operations must not be dependent on application running and must ensure that data in the DR region is up to date.Security - User's SecurityPin must be stored in such a way that access to the database does not allow the viewing of SecurityPins. The web application is the only system that should have access to SecurityPins. All certificates and secrets used to secure data must be stored in Azure Key Vault.

All access to Azure Storage and Azure SQL database must use the application's Managed Service Identity (MSI). Receipt data must always be encrypted at rest. All data must be protected in transit. User's expense account number must be visible only to logged in users. All other views of the expense account number should include only the last segment, with the remaining parts obscured. In the case of a security breach, access to all summary reports must be revoked without impacting other parts of the system.Issues -Upload format issue -Employees occasionally report an issue with uploading a receipt using the web application. They report that when they upload a receipt using the Azure FileShare, the receipt does not appear in their profile. When this occurs, they delete the file in the file share and use the web application, which returns a 500 InternalServer error page.Capacity issue -During busy periods, employees report long delays between the time they upload the receipt and when it appears in the web application.Log capacity issue -Developers report that the number of log messages in the trace output for the processor is too high, resulting in lost log messages.Application code -Processing.cs -Database.cs -ReceiptUploader.cs -ConfigureSSE.ps1 - Question You need to ensure receipt processing occurs correctly.What should you do?

The company is based in Canada and has retail store locations across the world. The company is developing several cloud-based solutions to support their stores, distributors, suppliers, and delivery services.Current environment -Corporate website -The company provides a public website located at http://www.vanarsdelltd.com. The website consists of a React JavaScript user interface, HTML, CSS, image assets, and several APIs hosted in Azure Functions.Retail Store Locations -The company supports thousands of store locations globally. Store locations send data every hour to an Azure Blob storage account to support inventory, purchasing and delivery services. Each record includes a location identifier and sales transaction information.Requirements -The application components must meet the following requirements:Corporate website - Secure the website by using SSL. Minimize costs for data storage and hosting. Implement native GitHub workflows for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). Distribute the website content globally for local use. Implement monitoring by using Application Insights and availability web tests including SSL certificate validity and custom header value verification. The website must have 99.95 percent uptime.Retail store locations - Azure Functions must process data immediately when data is uploaded to Blob storage. Azure Functions must update Azure Cosmos DB by using native SQL language queries. Audit store sale transaction information nightly to validate data, process sales financials, and reconcile inventory.Delivery services - Store service telemetry data in Azure Cosmos DB by using an Azure Function. Data must include an item id, the delivery vehicle license plate, vehicle package capacity, and current vehicle location coordinates. Store delivery driver profile information in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) by using an Azure Function called from the corporate website.Inventory services -The company has contracted a third-party to develop an API for inventory processing that requires access to a specific blob within the retail store storage account for three months to include read-only access to the data.Security - All Azure Functions must centralize management and distribution of configuration data for different environments and geographies, encrypted by using a company-provided RSA-HSM key. Authentication and authorization must use Azure AD and services must use managed identities where possible.Issues -Retail Store Locations - You must perform a point-in-time restoration of the retail store location data due to an unexpected and accidental deletion of data. Azure Cosmos DB queries from the Azure Function exhibit high Request Unit (RU) usage and contain multiple, complex queries that exhibit high point read latency for large items as the function app is scaling.

The company is based in Canada and has retail store locations across the world. The company is developing several cloud-based solutions to support their stores, distributors, suppliers, and delivery services.Current environment -Corporate website -The company provides a public website located at http://www.vanarsdelltd.com. The website consists of a React JavaScript user interface, HTML, CSS, image assets, and several APIs hosted in Azure Functions.Retail Store Locations -The company supports thousands of store locations globally. Store locations send data every hour to an Azure Blob storage account to support inventory, purchasing and delivery services. Each record includes a location identifier and sales transaction information.Requirements -The application components must meet the following requirements:Corporate website - Secure the website by using SSL. Minimize costs for data storage and hosting. Implement native GitHub workflows for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). Distribute the website content globally for local use. Implement monitoring by using Application Insights and availability web tests including SSL certificate validity and custom header value verification. The website must have 99.95 percent uptime.Retail store locations - Azure Functions must process data immediately when data is uploaded to Blob storage. Azure Functions must update Azure Cosmos DB by using native SQL language queries. Audit store sale transaction information nightly to validate data, process sales financials, and reconcile inventory.Delivery services - Store service telemetry data in Azure Cosmos DB by using an Azure Function. Data must include an item id, the delivery vehicle license plate, vehicle package capacity, and current vehicle location coordinates. Store delivery driver profile information in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) by using an Azure Function called from the corporate website.Inventory services -The company has contracted a third-party to develop an API for inventory processing that requires access to a specific blob within the retail store storage account for three months to include read-only access to the data.Security - All Azure Functions must centralize management and distribution of configuration data for different environments and geographies, encrypted by using a company-provided RSA-HSM key. Authentication and authorization must use Azure AD and services must use managed identities where possible.Issues -Retail Store Locations - You must perform a point-in-time restoration of the retail store location data due to an unexpected and accidental deletion of data. Azure Cosmos DB queries from the Azure Function exhibit high Request Unit (RU) usage and contain multiple, complex queries that exhibit high point read latency for large items as the function app is scaling.
